# CSS, advanced :computer:

## Description :speech_balloon:

* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used in web development to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. Advanced CSS refers to more sophisticated techniques and features beyond the basics, such as animations, transitions, grid and flexbox layouts, custom properties (variables), and media queries for responsive design. These advanced techniques enable developers to create more dynamic, responsive, and visually appealing websites. They also allow for better organization and reusability of CSS code, making it easier to maintain and update the style of large and complex websites.
